# MvcProjectCamp

### 🌟  Overview of the Project
#### This project was created using the MVC Project Camp training, which Murat Yücedağ published on YouTube for free. In this project -inspired by the 'Ekşi Sözlük' website- authors can write comments, send messages to other users, and create new topics. The administrator dominates the whole system and can access all transactions from the panel.

### ✔Author Panel
###  🔸Profile: The author can update personal information.
###  🔸Articles: The author can display the titles created by herself/himself.
###  🔸Headings: All headings found on the site are listed.
###  🔸Messages: The author can send messages to other users, view incoming messages, and reply to them.
###      -Also, the author can create a Draft Message, format and re-transmit it.
  
### ✔Admin Panel
###  🗂️Category: The list contains the categories where titles are added to the site.
###  📋Heading: The titles available on the site are listed and their contents can be displayed.
###  💼Article: All entries on the site are listed and the search filter can be applied.
###  👥Author: Those who sign up on the site are listed, and new users can be added.
###  📈Statistic: The site's data is listed.
###  🖼️Gallery: Images on the site are listed.
